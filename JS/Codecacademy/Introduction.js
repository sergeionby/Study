//   INTRODUCTION 4/10 - Data Types
    In JavaScript, there are seven fundamental data types:
        1) Number: Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 8, 1516, 23.42.
        2) String: Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (letters, numbers, spaces, symbols, etc.) surrounded by single quotes: ' ... ' or double quotes " ... ". Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of string as a fancy word for text.
        3) Boolean: This data type only has two possible values— either true or false (without quotes). It’s helpful to think of booleans as on and off switches or as the answers to a “yes” or “no” question.
        4) Null: This data type represents the intentional absence of a value, and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes).
        5) Undefined: This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined (without quotes). It also represents the absence of a value though it has a different use than null.
        6) Symbol: A newer feature to the language, symbols are unique identifiers, useful in more complex coding. No need to worry about these for now.
        7) Object: Collections of related data.
    The first 6 of those types are considered primitive data types. They are the most basic data types in the language. Objects are more complex.
